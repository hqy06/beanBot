- getting the correct medication needed
- understanding the nature of my mental health issues","Peer support: They are so easily accessible and available. They respectfully disclose that no one is a licensed counsellor or therapist. I think this service is perfect for someone who needs to give themselves advice the way they would advise a friend. These volunteers are clearly well-trained and show that they care. The person who worked with me was a great listener and guided me very well with the right questions. In the end, I felt like I had someone who listened to me, I had come up with some plan for my mental health and also felt like I had somewhat come to these solutions myself. Peer support aims not to tell you what to do, but rather ask the right questions to guide you to the right answer. It feels good to have someone help you along the way so that anxious thoughts don't muddle the right answer. I recommend peer support to my friends all the time because of their accessibility and helpfulness. "

- getting the correct medication needed
- understanding the nature of my mental health issues","Group Therapy: it is a very good service to take to develop general coping skills. It's something that I have to take initiative for by ensuring I attend and deciding what skills to take home to practice, so it's more difficult for me to get myself to go or feel productive there. However, the group therapy itself was very helpful. I personally feel that one-on-one therapy is better."

The second time, i went to see a psychiatrist about social anxiety. This psychiatrist was a lot more understanding and patient and he really tried to gather all the details to understand my situation.

She understands me very well and helps me with my social anxiety and mood. I am glad my experience with counselling has been good so far as i found the counsellor who is right for me. The only con would be that it usually takes 2-3 weeks to be able to book an appointment, so that is how frequent you would be able to see your counsellor. "

- getting the correct medication needed
- understanding the nature of my mental health issues","The psychiatrist as an individual is very helpful and has been a key part of my mental health journey. I appreciate the work that the psychiatrist has done with me. The psychiatric services system and the secretarial services of that department, however, has been very disappointing. While it is somewhat understandable that the process to see a psychiatrist may be a long and difficult process, the approach that the representatives use in explaining its difficulties is pretty abysmal. When I was first seeking psychiatric services, they immediately turned me away by stating that ""the waitlist is 5 months long"" and suggested no alternatives or next steps. The second time I sought their services, I had a hospital note at hand but they required a referral. I had been misinformed by the hospital of what I needed to get psychiatric help. Instead of guiding me to how I should request that a referral from my doctor, the secretary said ""we don't take this"" and gave no guidance or next steps. If it had not been for a community social worker who guided me along the way I would probably still not be receiving any psych services. The social worker had to go out of their way to call the hospital then McGill Psychiatric Services to get me an appointment. It shouldn't take these steps to get the help someone needs. I never recommend psychiatric services to my peers in need because my case was very different and I wouldn't know how to even get an appointment with them. It is difficult to feel that the psychiatric department is interested in helping when the frontline representatives don't behave that way."
