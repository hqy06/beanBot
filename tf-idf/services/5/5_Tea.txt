vent over tea is a free active listening service that pairs people who need to vent with an empathetic listener to chat in a local coffee shop. Based in Montreal and founded in April 2015 by McGill psychology graduates, our goal is to provide a casual, confidential and non-judgmental outlet for members of our community. Our program is based on studies that have shown the benefits derived from expressing one's self to a compassionate listener. We do not offer counselling, psychotherapy or advice. We provide you with a listening ear and a safe space to vent. We developped a unique training program with Stephane Bensoussan, holistic health and educational psychologist and director of PsySanté, that teaches our listeners how to actively listen and guide the conversation in a meaningful and empathetic way. Our volunteers can help you work through your problems by asking reflective questions and showing empathetic regard. All you need to do is select an available time and a coffee shop that you would like to meet in. One of our friendly volunteers will meet you there.



WHAT IS

Empathetic regard 



YOUR FIRST MEETING
What to Expect

You select a time and a café that works for you (if you can't think of one - don't worry we have a list of recommended ones that are cozy and ambient.)
Your listener will reach out to you by email to confirm the vent session, let you know what they'll be wearing and answer any of your pre-venting questions.
The two of you meet up at the café the day of your vent session. You each purchase your own beverage. 
You get venting!
