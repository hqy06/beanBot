Therapist Assisted Online (TAO) is an interactive, dynamic, and easy-to-access online program. It was designed for addressing issues related to anxiety and depression, which are the problems most commonly faced by students at McGill. TAO can provide resources and tools to promote healthy coping skills and help you bounce back from lifeâ€™s disappointments and frustrations. As a TAO participant, each week you will watch short videos and complete skill-building exercises. TAO is tailored to fit your schedule and your needs. The exercises can be completed through a smartphone, tablet, or computer and the online programs are accessible 24/7.
TAO is available to be completed as a stand-alone resource for preventative care or if you feel like you would require some additional support, you can schedule meetings with a clinician to briefly touch base as you progress through the online material.
