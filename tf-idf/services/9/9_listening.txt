What is the listening line?

The listening line provides an anonymous and easily accessible avenue for support and information for LGBITQ youths 14 to 25 and the wider community. It is one of the core services that we offer at Project 10. The listening line provides peer support, active listening, as well as information and referrals to LGBITQ services. The line may be particularly useful for people who are not ready to access services in person, or who live too far away to be able to make it to Project 10. It is open Tuesdays 12-6PM and Thursdays 1-6PM. Call us at 514-989-4585!
