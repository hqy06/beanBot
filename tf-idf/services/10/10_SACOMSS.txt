About Us
The Sexual Assault Centre of the McGill Studentsâ€™ Society (SACOMSS) is a volunteer-run organization committed to supporting survivors of sexual assault and their allies through direct support, advocacy, and outreach.

SACOMSS strives to be a pro-survivor, pro-feminist, anti-racist, anti-ableist, anti-classist, queer-positive, trans-positive and anti-oppressive organization. We provide an accessible, non-judgmental, and safer space for members of many different communities and identifications. All our services are open to the public and are provided free of charge.

The DIAL hotline service can be reached by phone at 514-398-8500. The hotline and drop-in service hours are updated weekly on our homepage and the SACOMSS Facebook page.
