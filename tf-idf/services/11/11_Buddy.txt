Welcome to the McGill International Buddy Program

To help you transition to your life in Montreal and McGill, the Buddy Program connects new international students with returning students. They provide the friendly face, helping hand, and first Montreal friendship that can make a world of difference for new arrivals. Buddies can also offer linguistic support, cultural guidance and information about life at McGill.

Now in its 30th year, the Buddy Program has helped thousands of international students - over 900 last year - settle into McGill and Montreal. Volunteers and new students are paired on a rolling basis during the year, allowing new students to be in touch with their buddies over the summer and winter. There is no hard deadline for signing up, although it's important for both volunteers and new students to sign up before the term begins in order to ensure a smooth pairing.

The program offers a lot of things that new students can benefit from, including linguisitic support, cultural guidance, and information about life at McGill! Typical activities that new students and buddies engage in include showing new students around campus, locating popular must-see attractions and other local amenities in Montreal, discussing Montreal neighbourhoods to find apartments, and even bonding over a cup of coffee.
