## summary

This is the keyword embedding ~~word2vec~~ part of beanBot project, in which we will try several embedding ~~wrod2vec~~ techniques and see how well they are performancing.

**[status]** Currently WIP (work in progress)

**[Assigned to]** Fiona!

### Things to try

1. one-hot (not good)
2. bag of words
3. term frequency-inverse document frequency
4. word2vec neural net

### Planner

[x] Read A LOT!

[x] Plan out todo list

[x] For each technique, do more readings.

[ ] Generate dataset using WordNet\*

[ ] Start coding......

### Note to Self

- one-hot isn't that good when you have a large dictionary
- bag of words is more domain specific than bag of words
-
